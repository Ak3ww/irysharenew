# AES-256-GCM Encryption Migration

## Overview

This document describes the migration from Lit Protocol to AES-256-GCM encryption for Iryshare's file sharing system.

## 🔐 **New Encryption System: AES-256-GCM**

### **Why AES-256-GCM?**

- **Military-grade security** - Used by banks, governments, military
- **Perfect address-specific access control** - Only shared wallets can decrypt
- **Built into browsers** - No external dependencies
- **Lightning fast** - Encrypts/decrypts instantly
- **Industry standard** - Proven, reliable technology

### **How It Works**

1. **Generate AES key** for each file
2. **Encrypt file** with AES-256-GCM
3. **Encrypt AES key** for each recipient using their wallet signature
4. **Store on Irys** - Encrypted file + encrypted keys
5. **Recipients decrypt** - Their signature unlocks their key, then decrypts file

### **Security Features**

✅ **Perfect Access Control** - Only owner and explicitly shared addresses can decrypt  
✅ **Address-Specific Keys** - Each recipient gets their own encrypted key  
✅ **Wallet Authentication** - Uses wallet signatures for authentication  
✅ **No Backdoors** - No server-side access to encrypted data  
✅ **Proven Technology** - Industry standard encryption  

## 📁 **File Structure**

```
src/utils/
├── encryption.ts          # AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption
├── aesIrys.ts            # Irys integration for AES encryption
└── lit.ts                # (Legacy) Lit Protocol (deprecated)
```

## 🔧 **Key Functions**

### **Encryption**
```typescript
encryptFileData(
  fileData: ArrayBuffer,
  recipientAddresses: string[],
  onProgress?: (progress: number) => void,
  ownerAddress?: string
): Promise<EncryptionResult>
```

### **Decryption**
```typescript
decryptFileData(
  encryptedFile: EncryptedFile,
  userAddress: string
): Promise<ArrayBuffer>
```

### **Irys Integration**
```typescript
uploadEncryptedToIrys(
  fileData: ArrayBuffer,
  fileName: string,
  fileType: string,
  ownerAddress: string,
  recipientAddresses: string[] = [],
  onProgress?: (progress: number) => void
): Promise<string>
```

## 🚀 **Migration Benefits**

### **Before (Lit Protocol)**
- ❌ Complex implementation
- ❌ Deployment issues on Vercel
- ❌ Access control problems
- ❌ Recipients couldn't decrypt
- ❌ Multiple TypeScript errors
- ❌ SIWE formatting issues

### **After (AES-256-GCM)**
- ✅ Simple, reliable implementation
- ✅ Works perfectly on Vercel
- ✅ Perfect address-specific access control
- ✅ All recipients can decrypt successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Built into browsers

## 🔄 **Migration Steps**

1. **Created new encryption system** - `encryption.ts`
2. **Created Irys integration** - `aesIrys.ts`
3. **Updated components** - Homepage, FilePreview
4. **Cleaned up console logs** - Professional logging
5. **Fixed UI issues** - File name truncation
6. **Removed Lit Protocol** - No longer needed

## 📊 **Performance Comparison**

| Metric | Lit Protocol | AES-256-GCM |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Speed** | Slow (external API) | Lightning fast (browser) |
| **Reliability** | Complex, error-prone | Simple, reliable |
| **Deployment** | Failed on Vercel | Works perfectly |
| **Access Control** | Broken | Perfect |
| **Dependencies** | Multiple external | Built into browser |

## 🛡️ **Security Analysis**

### **AES-256-GCM Security**
- **256-bit key** - Unbreakable with current technology
- **GCM mode** - Provides both encryption and authentication
- **Random IV** - Each encryption uses unique initialization vector
- **Wallet signatures** - Cryptographic proof of ownership

### **Access Control**
- **Address-specific keys** - Each recipient gets unique encrypted key
- **Signature verification** - Only wallet owner can decrypt their key
- **No server access** - Server cannot decrypt files
- **Perfect isolation** - Recipients cannot access each other's files

## 🔍 **Testing**

### **Test Cases**
1. ✅ **Owner upload** - File encrypted successfully
2. ✅ **Owner decrypt** - Can decrypt their own files
3. ✅ **Recipient decrypt** - Shared recipients can decrypt
4. ✅ **Access denied** - Unauthorized users cannot decrypt
5. ✅ **Multiple recipients** - Works with multiple addresses
6. ✅ **File types** - Works with all file types

### **Performance Tests**
- ✅ **Large files** - Handles files up to 100MB
- ✅ **Multiple files** - Concurrent uploads work
- ✅ **Network issues** - Graceful error handling
- ✅ **Browser compatibility** - Works in all modern browsers

## 📝 **Deployment Notes**

### **Environment Variables**
```env
REACT_APP_IRYS_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

### **Dependencies**
- ✅ `@irys/upload` - For Irys integration
- ✅ `ethers` - For wallet signatures
- ✅ Browser Web Crypto API - Built into browsers

### **Removed Dependencies**
- ❌ `@lit-protocol/*` - No longer needed
- ❌ `siwe` - No longer needed
- ❌ `libsodium-wrappers` - No longer needed

## 🎯 **Future Enhancements**

### **Planned Features**
- [ ] **Key rotation** - Periodically re-encrypt keys
- [ ] **Audit logging** - Track access attempts
- [ ] **Bulk operations** - Share multiple files at once
- [ ] **Advanced permissions** - Read-only vs full access

### **Security Improvements**
- [ ] **Hardware security modules** - For enterprise use
- [ ] **Multi-factor authentication** - Additional security layer
- [ ] **Time-based access** - Expiring shares
- [ ] **Geographic restrictions** - Location-based access

## 📞 **Support**

For issues or questions about the AES encryption system:

1. **Check console logs** - Look for `[AES]` or `[AES-Irys]` prefixes
2. **Verify wallet connection** - Ensure MetaMask is connected
3. **Check file permissions** - Verify recipient addresses
4. **Test with small files** - Start with simple text files
