# Iryshare Future Roadmap

## GraphQL Integration with Irys Network

### Overview
This document outlines the planned integration of Irys GraphQL capabilities to enable advanced analytics and cross-platform data querying.

### Current State
- Files are stored on Irys network with basic metadata
- Platform has internal analytics API
- User storage tracking implemented (12GB free credit)

### Planned GraphQL Features

#### 1. File Metadata Tagging
- **Public Files**: Tagged with user info, file type, size, upload date
- **Private Files**: Tagged with "private" flag, encrypted content
- **Searchable Tags**: File categories, user identifiers, platform metadata

#### 2. Cross-Platform Analytics
- **Platform Statistics**: Total users, files, storage usage
- **User Activity**: Upload patterns, file types, storage trends
- **Network Insights**: Irys transaction patterns, cost analysis

#### 3. Query Capabilities
- **Real-time Data**: Live platform statistics
- **Historical Trends**: Growth patterns, usage analytics
- **User Insights**: Anonymous aggregated data (privacy-focused)

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Metadata Enhancement
- [ ] Implement comprehensive file tagging system
- [ ] Create metadata schema for Irys transactions
- [ ] Develop tagging interface for uploads

#### Phase 2: GraphQL Schema
- [ ] Design GraphQL schema for file metadata
- [ ] Implement resolvers for platform statistics
- [ ] Create query endpoints for external platforms

#### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics
- [ ] Real-time dashboard updates
- [ ] Cross-platform data sharing
- [ ] Advanced querying capabilities

### Benefits
- **For Iryshare**: Better analytics, user insights, platform growth tracking
- **For External Platforms**: Access to platform statistics, user activity data
- **For Users**: Enhanced file organization, better search capabilities

### Privacy Considerations
- No individual user data exposed without consent
- Aggregated statistics only for public consumption
- Private file metadata remains encrypted and inaccessible

### Technical Requirements
- Irys GraphQL endpoint integration
- Metadata indexing and caching
- Rate limiting and access control
- Real-time data synchronization
